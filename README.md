Hand-written libretro bindings for the Zig programming language.

My hope is that this will be useful for people creating emulators and game engines in Zig, for years to come.
Consider giving a ‚≠ê if you like what you see!

‚ö†Ô∏è This is currently missing a bunch of functionality, and is not yet stable. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Getting started
### Prerequisites
- ‚ö° Zig 0.11 (latest as of July 2023)
- üëæ RetroArch or another libretro frontend
- üñºÔ∏è Optional: Cairo graphics library (to build the Cairo example)

### Building example cores
```sh
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSmall
```
This gives you very tiny shared objects.

### Running (RetroArch)
To run the `basic` example:
```sh
retroarch -L ./zig-out/lib/libbasic_libretro.so
```
